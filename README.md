# Zetetica-Policy
This privacy policy ("Policy") outlines the data practices of Giovanni Capuano ("I") with respect to Zetetica ("the Game"). The Game has been developed not just as a technical demonstration but as an immersive game experience, primarily showcasing my skills and the atmospheric ambiance of my game concept inspired by Undertale and Earthbound/Mother. Despite this evolution, the Game does not collect, store, or use any personal information from its users ("You").

Personal Information I Collect
The Game does not collect any form of personal data. This encompasses but is not limited to contact information, device information, usage data, or payment details. As Zetetica, the sole function of the Game is to demonstrate my abilities and the projected gaming environment without compromising user privacy.

How I Use Your Information
Since the Game does not collect any data, there is no information that is used for any purpose such as providing and maintaining a service, notifying changes to our service, providing customer care and support, analyzing usage to improve the service, monitoring the usage of the service, or addressing technical issues.

How I Share Your Information
As the Game does not gather any personal data, there is no user information to share with third parties, including advertising partners or analytics providers.

How I Store and Secure Your Information
The Game does not involve any data storage or security practices because it does not collect any user data.

Your Rights
As I do not collect any personal data, issues concerning access, rectification, erasure of data, etc. do not apply in the context of the Game.

Children's Privacy
Since the Game doesn't collect any personal information, the usage of the Game is safe for all age groups, including children.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
In case there are any changes to this privacy policy in the future, I will post them on this page and update the "Last updated" date accordingly. However, given the nature of the Game as an immersive experience that does not collect any personal data, significant changes to this policy are not anticipated.
